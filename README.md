# ABCpyScoringRules
Work on the ABCpyScoringRules project

ABCpyScoring Rules implements an extension of the existing ABCpy Package 

It adds the ability to run Stochastic Gradient Langevin Descent and Adjusted Stochastic Gradient Langevin Descent based sampling algorithms using Energy And Kernel Scoring rules. This gives the ability for the user to perform inference on the parameters of any user defined model for any set of observed values by simply generating pairs of simulations and their corresponding gradients with respect to the input parameters (which can be done easily via pytorch).
